rules:
  - Vi chattar p√• svenska
  - All code must use **TypeScript** (not plain JavaScript).
  - Use **React** as the framework.
  - Use **Material UI (MUI)** for UI components and styling.
  - The app should be **mobile-first** with bottom navigation tabs.
  - All UI text, labels, and navigation must be in **Swedish**.
  - Always add **detailed comments** in the code to explain logic and structure,
    since the user is new to React and TypeScript.
  - Keep the code clean and beginner-friendly: 
    use clear function names, avoid over-engineering.
  - Prefer **functional components** and React Hooks over class components.
  - Ensure the project structure is modular and easy to expand later.
  - When possible, follow **best practices from React and Material UI documentation**.
